## DP-UTIL: A Comprehensive Utility Analysis of Differential Privacy in Machine Learning

This repository contains the source code accompanying our [ACM CODASPY'22](http://www.codaspy.org/2022/) paper [DP-UTIL: A Comprehensive Utility Analysis of Differential Privacy in Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12998).

## Notes: 
* For Objective Perturbation, we used IBM Differential Privacy library

* For Gradient Perturbation, we used Tensorflow Privacy library.

* All required installations were done within Google colab.

* For LendingClub Loan and COVID-19 datasets, you have to add their path manually to your code.
