# DP-UTIL: A Comprehensive Utility Analysis of Differential Privacy in Machine Learning

This repository contains the source code accompanying our [ACM CODASPY'22](http://www.codaspy.org/2022/) paper [DP-UTIL: A Comprehensive Utility Analysis of Differential Privacy in Machine Learning]( https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13930).

For Objective Perturbation, we used IBM Differential Privacy library

For Gradient Perturbation, we used Tensorflow Privacy library.

All required installations were done within Google colab.

For datasets: you have to add their path manually to your code.
